<h2 id="_why_willow">Why Willow?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>Willow is a tool for making the kinds of computer user interfaces
typically used in experimental economics. Without Willow, you might
design such an interface from scratch, or by modifying earlier
from-scratch software written for similar experiments. Using Willow,
you can do the same thing, but faster and better.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Willow sets out to accomplish this goal not by providing canned
routines for commonly performed experiments. After all, it is
precisely because our experiments are different from what has gone
before that we bother with them. Rather, Willow is a generic toolkit
that makes a lot of the things we do in experimental economics easy.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>To use a Willow program, you need only install your program on a
single "monitor" computer. The computers used by your research
subjects will simply run a web browser, which connects to a web server
that runs on the monitor computer. The user interface for the subjects
will be displayed inside the browser window.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_screenshots">Screenshots</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>Willow is a versatile program, and you can use it for many different
interfaces; but you might just be curious what a Willow interface can
look like. Here are some examples taken from the first study that
used Willow at the Center for the Study of Neuroeconomics at George
Mason University.</p></div>

<h2 id="_installing_willow">Installing Willow</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>To install Willow, you extract the zip file to a convenient
location. You will do this anew for each of your Willow projects.  In
addition, you will need to have Python installed. Willow has been
tested using Python 2.6 on Ubuntu GNU/Linux. You should be able to use
it with Python 2.6 on Windows and Mac OSX as well. If you do not have
Python 2.6 on your computer, get it from
<a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.3/">http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.3/</a> and then come back. If
you are not sure whether you have Python 2.6 on your computer, just
move on to the next section of the manual. If things don't work,
you'll notice soon enough, and you can go back and install Python. Do
not use Python version 3. It will not work.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_using_willow">Using Willow</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>In the Willow folder, you will find a file named <tt>hello.py</tt>. You need
to run this file. On Windows and most Linux distributions, you can
double click on it. You can also run the command <tt>python hello.py</tt>
from the command line. Once the <tt>hello.py</tt> program is running, fire up
a web browser and point it to <tt>http://localhost:8000</tt>. You should see
a page that looks like so:</p></div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="sidebar-content">
<div class="para"><p>Hello World.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>In practice, while programming, you will want to run Willow from
within IDLE, which is the integrated development environment that
comes with Python. To do so, right-click <tt>hello.py</tt> and select "Edit
with IDLE". This will pop up an editor window with the <tt>hello.py</tt> code
in it:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content"></div></div>
<div class="para"><p>See here the code of a very simple but working Willow program. You can
run it using the <tt>Run &gt; Run Module</tt> menu option or by pressing
<tt>F5</tt>. Again, you now need to point a web browser to
<tt>http://localhost:8000</tt>.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>If you see an error message like "address already in use," you are
probably trying to run two instances of Willow simultaneously. You
should stop the first one first (just close the window).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Now, let us look at the above code. Most of it is boilerplate, but the
good news is that this is all the boilerplate you need. The first line
imports the willow library. It assumes that <tt>willow.py</tt> is in a
subdirectory <tt>willow</tt> of the directory in which <tt>hello.py</tt> is; this is
how things are set up for the sample programs, and if you put your own
programs in the same place, it will just work. The next two lines
define a session function, and the last line instructs Willow to start
the web server, using the session function that has just been defined.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Together, these four lines define a web server that you can connect to
from a browser. If the browser is running on the same machine as the
server, you can use <tt>http://localhost:8000</tt> as a URL. If it is running
somewhere else, you must find out the IP address of the server. (If
you don't know it, there is a whole chapter further down in the manual
about how to figure it out.) If the IP address is, say,
123.123.123.123, then you can reach your Willow server using
<tt>http://123.123.123.123:8000</tt>. The <tt>:8000</tt> part is called the port
number; you can specify a different port number as an extra argument
to <tt>run</tt> (e.g. <tt>run(session, 8001)</tt>) if you insist on a port different
from 8000.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Once the web server is running, for each client that connects to it,
the session function will be called once. It will keep running until
it returns. Each session function runs in its own thread. This means
that several "copies" of the session function are running
simultaneously.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>In this case, we want to simply display the text "Hello world." in the
web browser of every client that connects, so we have a very simple
session function that does nothing but <tt>add("&lt;h1&gt;Hello,
world.&lt;/h1&gt;")</tt>. The <tt>add()</tt> function adds an HTML snippet to the web
page being displayed in the client's browser.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_a_digression_on_your_ip_address">A digression on your IP address</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>You need the IP address of your monitor computer in order for your
client computers to connect to it. It would be convenient if Willow
could display the right IP address for you to use, but unfortunately,
this is easier said than done, since a computer can have multiple IP
addresses at the same time: IP version 4 and IP version 6, on the
wireless network, on the ethernet network, on the "loopback" network,
and so on.</p></div>

<div class="para"><p>There is much information here, but we only need a little. First,
notice that this computer has three network interfaces, called <tt>eth1</tt>,
<tt>eth2</tt> and <tt>lo</tt>. <tt>lo</tt> is the loopback device; it does not correspond
to any actual hardware, but it is rather a contraption that the
operating system uses so that you can make connections to your own
machine at address <tt>127.0.0.1</tt> even when the network is down. The
other two network devices are actual network cards that are in the
computer; as it happens, <tt>eth1</tt> is a wired Ethernet network, and
<tt>eth2</tt> is a wireless 802.11g network. According to the information
above, the computer has IP address 10.143.91.80 on <tt>eth2</tt>, and it has
no IP address on <tt>eth1</tt>, which makes sense, because the wired
connection was not plugged when I executed the command. In the output

those are not commonly used.</p></div>

</div>
<h2 id="_architecture">Architecture</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>In this section, I will describe some of the nuts and bolts of
Willow. It is not usually necessary to understand this, but it may be
helpful for those seeking to extend Willow or satisfy their curiosity.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The core of willow is made up of <tt>willow/willow.py</tt> and
<tt>willow/willow.js</tt> (which is included by <tt>willow/index.html</tt>). In
<tt>willow.py</tt>, the function <tt>run</tt> is defined, which starts a web
server. This web server serves GET requests in pretty much the normal
way, but it does something special using POST requests. In particular,
it expects POST requests to be Ajax calls ("<tt>XMLHttpRequest</tt>") from
<tt>willow.js</tt>. In fact, each running instance of <tt>willow.js</tt> (and there
is one per client) will always have one such request outstanding; when
a response comes in, a new one is generated immediately. This means
that the web server always has a way of talking to the client: it can
respond to the outstanding POST request. In order to keep track of the
outstanding POST requests, the web server is multithreaded; each
request gets its own thread. The web server threads, in their turn,
decide what to reply to a POST request by looking on a queue.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>For each client, there is a separate queue. Each client generates, in
JavaScript, a UUID, which it submits when it first connects, and which
the web server can use to map a POST request to the correct queue. The
reason that we do not use the sequential client numbers for this
purpose is that the way the protocol works implies that the first
contact is made by the client, and the clients have no way of doing
the communication required to make sure their client IDs are
sequential before they are actually talking to the server. UUIDs, on
the other hand, which are hashes of the wall clock time and a random
number, can be generated in a decentralized way. Once clients connect,
they are also assigned a sequential client number, which is exposed to
the user.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The web server does not busy itself with putting things on the
queues. That is what session threads are for. One session thread is
started each time a client connects for the first time. The session
thread is configurable; in fact, in runs whatever <tt>session</tt> function
is passed to <tt>run()</tt>. Each session thread is assigned a name which is
the sequential client number, and the queues are made indexable by
these numbers as well. (Note that this means we have two different
tables pointing to the same queues, one indexed by UUID, and one by
client number.)</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>It is these <tt>session</tt> functions that put things onto the queues. Each
session function has access to each of the queues, indexed by client
number, but it typically uses functions that automatically fill in the
client number that the particular session thread is associated
with. This is accomplished, of course, by looking at the thread name
of the current thread.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Last, we come to the tuple space. This is largely a convenience, and
could be used independently of the rest of Willow, but it has proven
to be a convenient way of doing IPC between the threads without
needing to understand overly complicated concurrency primitives.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">

</div>
</div>
<h2 id="_twig">Twig</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>Twig is an extension to Willow. It is a repository of code that shows
up over and over in experimental interface programs: code for logging
in terminals in a certain order, for doing surveys, etc. All of Twig
is written on top of Willow, and there is nothing in it that you
couldn't do yourself using Willow and some Python standard library
functions. If a Twig functions doesn't fit your needs, you can always
write your own (and maybe look at the Twig source code for
inspiration.)</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>To use Twig in your code, you have to add an additional import line to
the beginning of your file:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>from willow.twig import *</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>Twig internally uses tuples and HTML <tt>id+s that start with +__</tt> (two
underscores). If you plan to use Twig, you should avoid using any
tuples or HTML +id+s that start with two underscore, so as not to
interfere with Twig.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Twig is still under development, and as of right now, the interface to
Twig functions is likely change from one Willow version to the
next. (The interface to Willow functions may also change, but I try to
avoid that, and make mention of it in the manual.)</p></div>
<h3 id="_tt_assemble_tt"><tt>assemble()</tt></h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="para"><p>Willow offers only a very basic mechanism for identifying clients: the
numbers returned by <tt>me()</tt>, which are assigned to clients in the order
in which they first connect. If you have a program launcher in your
lab that automatically launches clients on a number of terminals
around the room, you can end up with these client numbers being
distributed around the room in strange ways, based on which machines
are the fastest to connect. In practice, you may want to have a more
stable mapping between terminals and client identifiers. That is where
<tt>assemble()</tt> comes in.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The way you typically call <tt>assemble()</tt> is at the beginning of your
session function, like so:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>def session():
    number, numbers = assemble()

    # ... your code ...

run(session)</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>Now, when you connect a bunch of clients, you will see a button
labeled "0" on the first ("monitor") client, and buttons labeled "Log
in" on all other ("subject") clients. As you click these "Log in"
buttons on the subject clients, they will each be assigned a
number. These numbers are independent from the numbers returned by
<tt>me()</tt>, and they are assigned, starting with 1, in the order in which
the "Log in" buttons are clicked.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>When you have pressed all the "Log in" buttons, you can go back to the
monitor client, and you will see that by now, it has a sequence of
buttons with labels like:</p></div>
<div class="ilist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
0
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
0, 1
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
0, 1, 2
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
0, 1, 2, 3
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="para"><p>These buttons allow you to decide which of the subjectclients to
actually use. This is particularly useful when you want to set up an
experiment that may have a different number of participants based on
actual turnout: you can set up the lab with, say, 12 logged in
machines, and if only 10 students turn out, you click the button
labeled "0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10+.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Once one of the buttons on the monitor is clicked, the <tt>assemble()</tt>
function returns a tuple of two elements. The first is the subject ID
newly associated with the current thread, or, if the subject is not
included on the button clicked on the monitor, <tt>None</tt>. The second is a
list of all the subject IDs, including <tt>0</tt> (which refers to the
monitor).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>One further feature of <tt>assemble()</tt> is revealed when you use
non-standard URLs to load the subject clients. For instance, if your
Willow instance is running on a machine with IP address <tt>1.2.3.4</tt>, you
would normally use <tt>http://1.2.3.4:8000/</tt> to connect, but you could
also use <tt>http://1.2.3.4:8000/42</tt>. In that case, the subject
identifier will be assigned not sequentially but according to the
number at the end of the URL. This is useful if you have a centralized
program launcher facility in your lab that is able to open different
web pages on different terminals. In that case, you can simply
configure the program launcher to open <tt>http://1.2.3.4:8000/1</tt> on the
first machine, <tt>http://1.2.3.4:8000/2</tt> on the second machine, etc.,
and you will be assured that subject IDs are assigned in a
predetermined way.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Here's an example of how to use <tt>assemble()</tt>:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>def session():
    number, numbers = assemble()
    if number == 0:
       set("MONITOR&lt;p&gt;Using Subject IDs %r" % numbers)
    else:
       set("&lt;p&gt;This client has Subject ID %d" % number)

run(session)</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<h3 id="_tt_survey_title_number_questions_selector_tt"><tt>survey(title, number, questions, [selector])</tt></h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="para"><p>This is used for surveys. A typical use would be:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>
MYSURVEY = [
  ("Do you like chocolate?", ("Yes", "No"))
]

if me() &gt; 0:
  survey("FOOD", me(), MYSURVEY)</tt></pre>

=== assemble(session, clients=[], port=8000)

This function is a replacement for run(). If clients is not
specified, it will display buttons on client 0 as clients 1, 2,
... log on, which show subsets of the clients that have logged on so
far. You can click one of these buttons at any time, and at that
point, the function session() will be run once for each client IN
THE SUBSET, with its client ID as the first number and the list of
all client IDs IN THE SUBSET as its second argument. Clients that
have connected but that are not in the subset will get a big X on
their screens. The second way of using assemble() is to specify an
explicit argument for clients=, some list of integers that indicates
which clients you want. Once those client numbers have logged on,
the session function is started once for every such client, and
again any clients not in the set get a big X.
